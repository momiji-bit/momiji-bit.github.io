<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I‚Äôm currently pursuing an **MSc in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging** at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). Under the supervision of [**Assoc. Kaan Ak≈üit**](https://www.kaanaksit.com/), my current research focuses on text-guided video anomaly detection (VAD) based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), aiming to enable fine-grained, interpretable, and human-centered video understanding.

I received my **BEng in Computer Science and Technology** from [Hefei University of Technology](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/), School of Computer Science and Information Engineering (School of Artificial Intelligence), where I was supervised by [**Prof. Dan Guo**](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/gd/en/index.htm). During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on visual perception systems for assisting visually impaired individuals, exploring multimodal sensing, intelligent interaction, and navigation technologies.

My research interests span **computer vision**, **multimodal learning**, and **vision-language understanding**, with an emphasis on perception, reasoning, and generation in visual intelligence. I am particularly interested in building systems that connect human motion, emotion, and cognition through multimodal signals, with additional interests in autonomous driving and environmental perception.

If you are seeking any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to contact me.

- *2025.09 - now*: MABench: Towards Fine-grained Micro-Action Understanding

  **Jihao Gu**, [Kun Li](https://kunli-cs.github.io/)

  > We aim to bridge the gap between Micro-Action Recognition and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by constructing a fine-grained visual-text dataset.

- *2025.03 - 2025.09*: Text-guided Recognition of Events for Anomaly Detection

  [Postgraduate Project] [Thesis]

  **Jihao Gu**, [Kaan Ak≈üit (Supervisor)](https://kaanaksit.com/)

  > Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs are offering limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Recognition of Events for Anomaly Detection (TREAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). TREAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. Our proposed method achieves SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% micro-AUC and 67.8% / 76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC / TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively more preferable textual descriptions on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%).

- *2024.01 - 2024.06*: Enhancing the Baseline Performance of OrienterNet for Visual Localization

  **Jihao Gu**, [Yan Da (Supervisor)](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/yanda/home.html)

  > Our task aims to further optimize OrienterNet, a neural network-based visual localization method designed to achieve accurate localization using 2D public maps (e.g., planar maps). The original approach matches camera-captured images with public maps, effectively addressing localization challenges in GPS-denied scenarios, especially in indoor and complex urban environments.

  **Jihao Gu**, [Guo Dan (Supervisor)](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/gd/zh_CN/index.htm)

  > This thesis proposes a visually aware navigation system to assist visually impaired individuals in outdoor travel. By integrating computer vision, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing technologies, the system captures environmental information using a binocular camera and processes the data through advanced algorithms such as object detection and semantic segmentation. The primary contributions of this thesis are as follows: (1) the design and implementation of a navigation system based on visual environmental perception; (2) the proposal of a deep intelligent interaction-based outdoor assistance method tailored for visually impaired individuals; (3) the development of an offset warning system leveraging semantic segmentation techniques; (4) the introduction of a collision warning method utilizing image-based object detection and visual depth estimation; (5) the formulation of a route planning method founded on weighted undirected graph principles; and (6) the construction of a road image dataset specifically for the Hefei University of Technology campus.
