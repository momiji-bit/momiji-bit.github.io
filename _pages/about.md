<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently a **Research Assistant** at the [Computational Light Laboratory](https://complightlab.com), University College London, working under the supervision of [**Assoc. Kaan Akşit**](https://www.kaanaksit.com/). I am also in the process of applying for PhD programs in Computer Vision.

I recently completed my **MSc in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging** at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). Under the supervision of [**Assoc. Kaan Akşit**](https://www.kaanaksit.com/), my research centers on text-guided video anomaly detection (VAD) based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), aiming to enable fine-grained, interpretable, and human-centered video understanding.

I received my **BEng in Computer Science and Technology** from [Hefei University of Technology](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/), School of Computer Science and Information Engineering (School of Artificial Intelligence), where I was supervised by [**Prof. Dan Guo**](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/gd/en/index.htm). During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on visual perception systems for assisting visually impaired individuals, exploring multimodal sensing, intelligent interaction, and navigation technologies.

My research interests span **computer vision**, **multimodal learning**, and **vision-language understanding**, with an emphasis on perception, reasoning, and generation in visual intelligence. I am particularly interested in building systems that connect human motion, emotion, and cognition through multimodal signals, with additional interests in autonomous driving and environmental perception.

# 🔬 Projects

- *2025.09 - 2025.11*: MABench: Towards Fine-grained Micro-Action Understanding

  **Jihao Gu**, [Kun Li](https://kunli-cs.github.io/)

  > - Proposed MA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,000 videos and a three-tier evaluation architecture that progressively examines micro-action perception, relational comprehension, and interpretive reasoning
  > - Constructed MA-Bench-Train, a large-scale training corpus with 20K videos annotated for detailed motion patterns and finetuned Qwen3-VL-8B on MA-Bench-Train, achieving consistent gains across micro-action reasoning tasks

- *2025.03 - 2025.09*: Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly

  [Postgraduate Project] [Thesis]

  **Jihao Gu**, [Kaan Akşit (Supervisor)](https://kaanaksit.com/), [He Wang (Co-supervisor)](https://drhewang.com/)

  > - Proposed Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)
  > - Introduced an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps
  > - Designed a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos
  > - Achieved SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% micro-AUC and 67.8% / 76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC / TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset


- *2024.01 - 2024.06*: Enhancing the Baseline Performance of OrienterNet for Visual Localization

  **Jihao Gu**, [Yan Da (Supervisor)](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/yanda/home.html)

  > Our task aims to further optimize OrienterNet, a neural network-based visual localization method designed to achieve accurate localization using 2D public maps (e.g., planar maps). The original approach matches camera-captured images with public maps, effectively addressing localization challenges in GPS-denied scenarios, especially in indoor and complex urban environments.

- *2022.12 - 2023.10*: End-to-End Sign Language Recognition using Transformers, 12/2022 - 10/2023

  **Jihao Gu**, [Shengeng Tang](https://tangshengeng.github.io/)

  > - Read and analyzed two papers in detail, and learned the application of the Transformer architecture in sign language recognition and the design idea of the dual-block module
  > - Used the PyTorch toolkit to reproduce the model in the paper, and achieved similar BLEU and WER scores on the validation set and test set
  > - Combined the dual-block module with the reproduced model, and enhanced the BLEU and WER scores on the validation set and test set by parameter adjustment and multiple rounds of training


- *2021.06 - 2024.06*: Navigation System for Visually Impaired People Based on Visual Ambient Intelligence

  [Undergraduate Project] [[Thesis](https://github.com/momiji-bit/Bachelor-s-Degree-Project/blob/main/[终版]谷纪豪_毕业论文.pdf)] [[Project](https://github.com/momiji-bit/UG-Thesis-VEPNav)]

  **Jihao Gu**, [Guo Dan (Supervisor)](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/gd/zh_CN/index.htm), [Meng Wang (Co-supervisor)](https://sites.google.com/view/meng-wang/home)

  > - Designed and implemented a navigation system based on visual environmental perception, with accuracy increased by approximately 15% compared with traditional navigation systems
  > - Proposed a deep intelligent interaction-based outdoor assistance method tailored for visually impaired individuals
  > - Developed an offset warning system leveraging semantic segmentation techniques
  > - Introduced a collision warning method utilizing image-based object detection and visual depth estimation
  > - Formulated a route planning method founded on weighted undirected graph principles
  > - Constructed a road image dataset specifically for the Hefei University of Technology campus, which contains over 12,000 images
