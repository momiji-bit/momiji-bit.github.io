<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I‚Äôm currently pursuing an **MSc in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging** at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). Under the supervision of [**Assoc. Kaan Ak≈üit**](https://www.kaanaksit.com/), my current research focuses on text-guided video anomaly detection (VAD) based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), aiming to enable fine-grained, interpretable, and human-centered video understanding.

I received my **BEng in Computer Science and Technology** from [Hefei University of Technology](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/), School of Computer Science and Information Engineering (School of Artificial Intelligence), where I was supervised by [**Prof. Dan Guo**](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/gd/en/index.htm). During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on visual perception systems for assisting visually impaired individuals, exploring multimodal sensing, intelligent interaction, and navigation technologies.

My research interests span **computer vision**, **multimodal learning**, and **vision-language understanding**, with an emphasis on perception, reasoning, and generation in visual intelligence. I am particularly interested in building systems that connect human motion, emotion, and cognition through multimodal signals, with additional interests in autonomous driving and environmental perception.

If you are seeking any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to contact me.
